# Project Overview
For our Unit 3 project, we are working in a group format to recreate the Airbnb Official Site. For our technologies, we are using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and React for the Front-End development, and on the backend, we used Express.js, PostgreSQL, Postman, and Postico to build the server and database.


## Project Description

The React web application will include the AirBnb's home page which will include a search form and navigation routing bar. There will be various routes that the user can take to search listings in New York as well as single listing to view.
