	The most important thing I want is for you and your family to feel at home and have the best of times during your stay at my place. Let me know anything I can assist you with before arriving and throughout your stay. Its a cool place in a cool neighborhood. I am always nearby, but your privacy is supreme. Here are the rules; I  would appreciate you following:
	1. Respect other occupants that are in the building especially in the hallways, and limit yourselves to my third floor apartment. I know you are on vacation, but try to be noise considerate early in the mornings and after 10 pm at night.

	2. Please lift your luggage if checking in or out early/late instead of rolling due to the hardwood floors in the hallways and space.

	3. Be neat, do your own dishes and beds and respect the nice furnishings we have provided you.
	Please put all food in the refrigerator especially if it is in an opened container or bag. I have no roaches or pest and want to keep it that way!

	4. Separate the recycling from garbage in the appropriate bags we provide. Tuesday night is the night to set out the bottles and rinsed plastic food containers in the clear bags provided. Friday night is garbage night. Either I or my assistant will pass by to pick it up on those nights, if you cannot put it out yourself.

	5. Do not leave any appliance on if you are not in the apartment. This includes the portable air conditioners which should be turned off or at least to low when you are out of the apartment.

	6. Do not leave the tub running if you are not in the apartment.

	7. Do not leave the stove or fireplace going if you are not in the apartment.

	8. Please contact me or my assistant via airbnb, calling, personal email or simply knock on my door for any doubts, wishes or concerns.

	9. Do not dispose of anything like tampons, diapers, or paper towels in the toilet.
	Only toilet paper please! Use the garbage can in the bathroom for tampons, Q tips, paper towels, diapers etc.

	10. Do not loose the keys to the house or the apartment. $250 lost key charge.

	11. Please do not leave food out on the counters, top of the refrigerator or table. Put all food items in the refrigerator. With food containers that are put in trash or recycling, make sure they are rinsed. There is a steel garbage can with a lid under the ladder going to the roof in the hallway. Please put your daily garbage tied with a twisty there. Recycling gets put out every Tuesday evening in the clear bags provided. Trash gets put out in black garbage bags on Friday night.

	12. Enjoy my space, you are my friend(s), and let me or my wonderful assistant and friend Azul, know anything we can assist you with.

	12. If you need to have something delivered to you while staying at my place, I will facilitate my postal service address a few blocks up the street so you can be around on the town instead of sitting in the apartment waiting for a package.

	13. No smoking of any kind in the hallway or apartment please!

	14. Do not be drinking, smoking or hanging out on the fire escape. No children ever on roof or fire escape. These are to be used only as a fire escape!

I have been hosting for about 3 years now, and it has been a fantastic time! I have met some very cool and interesting people, had some great discussions, and enjoyed helping my guests experience what NYC has to offer. I am in my late 30s, gay, and work as a psychotherapist in Manhattan.

	 I try to create a comfortable space that visitors can enjoy while they explore the city - and I am always happy to give advice or do what I can to make their visit a better experience. Of course I know that you are here on your vacation, so I make sure to be respectful of your relaxation time and privacy as well.

	 If you have questions or would like to book, please send me an inquiry with your dates. Also please tell me a little bit about yourself. I look forward to hearing from you! Oh je parle francais, y hablo espanol tambien. Best, Tim

	 I have travelled almost all of Europe, parts of Middle East-Asia, and some of Latin America.

	 I believe that travelling and meeting new people is an essential part of being a well-rounded person, and a crucial element for everyone who has ever been curious about the world and its mysteries.

	 After having travelled so much I began to realize the importance of find a comfortable place to stay and the difficulties in finding such a place – as to why I began hosting with AirBnb, to help other fellow travellers find a comfortable place to stay.

I have been hosting for about 3 years now, and it has been a fantastic time! I have met some very cool and interesting people, had some great discussions, and enjoyed helping my guests experience what NYC has to offer. I am in my late 30s, gay, and work as a psychotherapist in Manhattan.

	 I try to create a comfortable space that visitors can enjoy while they explore the city - and I am always happy to give advice or do what I can to make their visit a better experience. Of course I know that you are here on your vacation, so I make sure to be respectful of your relaxation time and privacy as well.

	The most important thing I want is for you and your family to feel at home and have the best of times during your stay at my place. Let me know anything I can assist you with before arriving and throughout your stay. Its a cool place in a cool neighborhood. I am always nearby, but your privacy is supreme. Here are the rules; I  would appreciate you following:
	1. Respect other occupants that are in the building especially in the hallways, and limit yourselves to my third floor apartment. I know you are on vacation, but try to be noise considerate early in the mornings and after 10 pm at night.

	2. Please lift your luggage if checking in or out early/late instead of rolling due to the hardwood floors in the hallways and space.

	3. Be neat, do your own dishes and beds and respect the nice furnishings we have provided you.
	Please put all food in the refrigerator especially if it is in an opened container or bag. I have no roaches or pest and want to keep it that way!

	4. Separate the recycling from garbage in the appropriate bags we provide. Tuesday night is the night to set out the bottles and rinsed plastic food containers in the clear bags provided. Friday night is garbage night. Either I or my assistant will pass by to pick it up on those nights, if you cannot put it out yourself.

	5. Do not leave any appliance on if you are not in the apartment. This includes the portable air conditioners which should be turned off or at least to low when you are out of the apartment.

	6. Do not leave the tub running if you are not in the apartment.

	7. Do not leave the stove or fireplace going if you are not in the apartment.

	8. Please contact me or my assistant via airbnb, calling, personal email or simply knock on my door for any doubts, wishes or concerns.

	9. Do not dispose of anything like tampons, diapers, or paper towels in the toilet.
	Only toilet paper please! Use the garbage can in the bathroom for tampons, Q tips, paper towels, diapers etc.

	10. Do not loose the keys to the house or the apartment. $250 lost key charge.

	11. Please do not leave food out on the counters, top of the refrigerator or table. Put all food items in the refrigerator. With food containers that are put in trash or recycling, make sure they are rinsed. There is a steel garbage can with a lid under the ladder going to the roof in the hallway. Please put your daily garbage tied with a twisty there. Recycling gets put out every Tuesday evening in the clear bags provided. Trash gets put out in black garbage bags on Friday night.

	12. Enjoy my space, you are my friend(s), and let me or my wonderful assistant and friend Azul, know anything we can assist you with.

	12. If you need to have something delivered to you while staying at my place, I will facilitate my postal service address a few blocks up the street so you can be around on the town instead of sitting in the apartment waiting for a package.

	13. No smoking of any kind in the hallway or apartment please!

	14. Do not be drinking, smoking or hanging out on the fire escape. No children ever on roof or fire escape. These are to be used only as a fire escape!

	15. As you leave the buildings street door on the first level, make sure the door shuts behind you. I nor anyone else in the building have ever had a theft issue, the neighborhood is super safe, but it is NYC.',

	The most important thing I want is for you and your family to feel at home and have the best of times during your stay at my place. Let me know anything I can assist you with before arriving and throughout your stay. Its a cool place in a cool neighborhood. I am always nearby, but your privacy is supreme. Here are the rules; I  would appreciate you following:
	1. Respect other occupants that are in the building especially in the hallways, and limit yourselves to my third floor apartment. I know you are on vacation, but try to be noise considerate early in the mornings and after 10 pm at night.

	2. Please lift your luggage if checking in or out early/late instead of rolling due to the hardwood floors in the hallways and space.

	3. Be neat, do your own dishes and beds and respect the nice furnishings we have provided you.
	Please put all food in the refrigerator especially if it is in an opened container or bag. I have no roaches or pest and want to keep it that way!

	4. Separate the recycling from garbage in the appropriate bags we provide. Tuesday night is the night to set out the bottles and rinsed plastic food containers in the clear bags provided. Friday night is garbage night. Either I or my assistant will pass by to pick it up on those nights, if you cannot put it out yourself.

	5. Do not leave any appliance on if you are not in the apartment. This includes the portable air conditioners which should be turned off or at least to low when you are out of the apartment.

	6. Do not leave the tub running if you are not in the apartment.

	7. Do not leave the stove or fireplace going if you are not in the apartment.

	8. Please contact me or my assistant via airbnb, calling, personal email or simply knock on my door for any doubts, wishes or concerns.

	9. Do not dispose of anything like tampons, diapers, or paper towels in the toilet.
	Only toilet paper please! Use the garbage can in the bathroom for tampons, Q tips, paper towels, diapers etc.

	10. Do not loose the keys to the house or the apartment. $250 lost key charge.

	11. Please do not leave food out on the counters, top of the refrigerator or table. Put all food items in the refrigerator. With food containers that are put in trash or recycling, make sure they are rinsed. There is a steel garbage can with a lid under the ladder going to the roof in the hallway. Please put your daily garbage tied with a twisty there. Recycling gets put out every Tuesday evening in the clear bags provided. Trash gets put out in black garbage bags on Friday night.

	12. Enjoy my space, you are my friend(s), and let me or my wonderful assistant and friend Azul, know anything we can assist you with.

	12. If you need to have something delivered to you while staying at my place, I will facilitate my postal service address a few blocks up the street so you can be around on the town instead of sitting in the apartment waiting for a package.

	13. No smoking of any kind in the hallway or apartment please!

	14. Do not be drinking, smoking or hanging out on the fire escape. No children ever on roof or fire escape. These are to be used only as a fire escape!

	15. As you leave the buildings street door on the first level, make sure the door shuts behind you. I nor anyone else in the building have ever had a theft issue, the neighborhood is super safe, but it is NYC.',

I am in my late 30s, gay, and work as a psychotherapist in Manhattan.

	 I try to create a comfortable space that visitors can enjoy while they explore the city - and I am always happy to give advice or do what I can to make their visit a better experience. Of course I know that you are here on your vacation, so I make sure to be respectful of your relaxation time and privacy as well.

	 If you have questions or would like to book, please send me an inquiry with your dates. Also please tell me a little bit about yourself. I look forward to hearing from you! Oh je parle francais, y hablo espanol tambien. Best, Tim

	'Hey, I’m Tim - a New Yorker with who has lived also in San Francisco, New Orleans and a number of places outside the US as well (from Africa to Europe). I have been hosting for about 3 years now, and it has been a fantastic time! I have met some very cool and interesting people, had some great discussions, and enjoyed helping my guests experience what NYC has to offer. I am in my late 30s, gay, and work as a psychotherapist in Manhattan.

	 I try to create a comfortable space that visitors can enjoy while they explore the city - and I am always happy to give advice or do what I can to make their visit a better experience. Of course I know that you are here on your vacation, so I make sure to be respectful of your relaxation time and privacy as well.

	 If you have questions or would like to book, please send me an inquiry with your dates. Also please tell me a little bit about yourself. I look forward to hearing from you! Oh je parle francais, y hablo espanol tambien. Best, Tim

A great launching pad to explore the city!',
	'The space
	Mid-century modern and rustic pieces decorate the space alongside plenty of typographic and illustrative art. Hardwood floors bathed with great morning light, the apartment is quiet and relaxing—a perfect place to come home to after an exhausting day running around the massive and fast-paced city.
	A ground level apartment in the back of the building, it is a quiet space that can be ideal for all travelers including seniors. The bathroom has bars in the shower for secured support. Generous closet space and storage for your luggage is available in your room.',

Weekends we tend to relax a bit in the living room and read or go to the park with Oreo.',

	I enjoyed staying at this place. He was very responsive, quick to answer my questions. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and his apartment is very quiet for Manhattan. There are a lot of great restaurants and attractions in the neighborhood. A subway stop is very close by. Literally, at the end of the block you will find a stop with two major lines. Yoni is kind and gave me all the space I need. His dog, Oreo, is adorable. I recommend.',

	There is not much beyond five starts that needs to be said. Yoni, Matthew and Oreo are great hosts. Their home is a home; it is lived in and it has the personal touches that screams "someone lives here" while also being tidy, warm and comfortable. I could make any number of tiny complaints that would be personal to me and being in a city far from home and a bed that is not mine, but really those are specific to each person and has no bearing on the space. I absolutely loved staying here and would do so again in a heartbeat. Yoni and Matthew really go above and beyond, communicate well, and make this a fantastic stay. Thank you again!',

	'Location, location, location! Large, classy, timeless, comfortable, entire top floor with private entrance in our private house out of a 1890s novel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn one block from the East River. So easy to get to Manhattan by subway, ferry, cab or even foot, and all the best places in the Burg Wifi/cableTV/air/heat.
	(We stay in our separate floor below you never compromising your privacy!)',

	'The space

	Perfect location on the Northside Williamsburg, Brooklyn Waterfront scene, my place is a wood beamed classic, with hard wood floors and restored original brick wall. It is the top floor of a 1894 restored house on a very nice semi residential street block. The nicely outfitted place, "the country in the sky" as I refer to it, has a beautiful totally functional "Peerless" antique prewar stove for cooking, generous amounts of pots, a wood burning fire place and a full size refrigerator in the kitchen. The feelings are cozy, warm, cabin like yet elegant. The kitchen and living room are in the same open area. There is a dining room table that seats 4, a beautiful brand new couch that folds down to become a very comfortable queen size bed that sleeps 2. Beyond the living area is the large master bedroom with a queen size bed that sleeps 2 with a large antique dresser and 2 riverside windows. Off the master bedroom is a large tiled classic bathroom with an antique skylight and large tub with shower, and a small bedroom with a twin size bed and riverside window that is nice as a separate rest area, a great place for a child to sleep, or an out of sight room to put your luggage and things.
	My location is beyond great and safe. 10 minutes maximum in a cab or car service over the Williamsburg Bridge and you are in Manhattan. It is a short walk (3 min) to the North 6th Street East River Ferry ( the scenic quick river route to Midtown Manhattan or lower Manhattan, please check schedules). Subways: L train ( gray line): First stop in Brooklyn, only one stop to Manhattan and a neat 10 minute walk from my place going by shops, restaurants and street vendors to the very frequent Northside L train subway stop at Bedford Ave and North 7 St, (Everything you want to pick up to take back to my place is on Bedford Ave or Kent Avenue which are the walking routes to the subway. (Among the small shops, restaurants and bars, there is now a "Whole Foods" supermarket and a Iphone store on Bedford!) The JM subway that goes over the Williamsburg Bridge with wonderful views of the river and NYC skyline to lower Manhattan (Chinatown etc), is a little further (13 min walk ) through the South Side. After a night out in the neighborhood, you will find this quiet, comfortable, timeless place to come home to that is the top floor of a restored Williamsburg house. All East River parks are a short walk away with their spectacular river and skyline views. During the warm months the weekend flea/food markets down Kent Avenue/North 8 on weekends are fun and back dropped by the river and Manhattan skyline. Grand Street River Park is only a block and a half away. I love going there in the mornings with a cup of tea and taking in the NYC view. The quaint restaurants and music clubs are amazing and abundant, the Williamsburg Foodtown Market has all the groceries you need and frankly the only reason I would leave the Burg would be to go to a museum, St. Patrick''s, Grand Central''s Oyster Bar or ice skating at Rockerfeller Center. Indoor Flea Market on North 7th right off Kent Ave, Mast Brothers Chocolate on North 3rd off Berry, Beer Garden restaurant lunch, dinner, brunch with live music on Friday nights on North 3rd and Berry, Sea restaurant (Thai) on North 6, Sweet Water (Bistro) restaurant on North 6, Dumont Burger for awesome burgers on Bedford between South 2-3,
	Aurora (Northern Italian) with great brunches, lunches and dinners is right around the corner as is Coxleys sport bar with 40 beers on tap and great chicken wings on Grand St. Teddys rest and bar (American Bistro) on North 8, a landmark that serves brunch, lunch and dinner and also has music sometimes at night, and the Knitting Factory music performance space and bar is 6 blocks away on Metropolitan. The best NY steak house, Peter Lugers reservations only, is in the vicinity.

	The floor is divided in 4 areas: upon entering you are in the kitchen and living, dining room with a wall and door that separates this space from the large bedroom in the front, the large tiled bathroom and the smaller front bedroom. The living area can easily convert to a sleeping area for 2. The place is adorable and sleeps four comfortably. Much quieter than most places in the area. Heat, air conditioning, wifi, fine linens/towels and kitchen utensils are provided for my guest.
	Full laundry drop off service and dry cleaners is available a couple of blocks up the street at Berry Cleaners or 302 Bedford Ave. My personal assistant/butler and I will check with you on your arrival time, hand over keys and be close at hand for anything you need during your stay. I and my husband are on our private lower floor of the house.',

	Si, hablo bien espanol, Français parlé assez bien.',
	'The space

	Downtown Manhattan, .. just like you see it in the films. Only so much better in real life !!

	All the details are below so that will see all that you will experience on your trip to the Big Apple - there are lots of things you will love when you stay here, but PLEASE PLEASE (did I say please?) try to read all the way to the end of the description, including sleeping arrangements, information on the area, getting around and the frequently asked questions. I know it is a bit of a novel, but it is well worth it and, from experience, it makes sure you understand everything in detail and ensures you will have the best stay that you can. Anything at all that you are not sure about, if you are new to Airbnb for example, just ask and I will get back asap and clarify.

	• Very spacious loft apartment ( about 2000 sq feet, 188 sq m, at last measure - so very BIG for New York) in the center of arguably the coolest area of the city (please do not argue ), modern, minimalist furniture , very open, very clean, I take great pride in having a spotless living environment (that goes for the host too). A Massive space that gets flooded with light via a wall of windows. Just take a look at the pictures. High security. Walking distance to subways & museums. Friendly building and very safe neighborhood.

	• Your own PRIVATE bathroom - Large, spacious, with Jacuzzi Bath, Shower, Hairdryer, Kohler fixtures. Fresh towels etc. Fully-stocked. All the shampoo and things you will ever need. Just for you.

	• Your own PRIVATE bedroom - Queen Bed for 2, firm and soft pillows for every type of sleeper, linens, towels, Large Flat Screen TV, Netflix, Amazon TV etc, Wardrobe. Again only for you.

	• Large kitchen - Open concept with an area to eat and with everything you need to design a gourmet feast, top of the line GE appliances, Microwave, Toaster, Kettle , Dishwasher, stainless steel counter top etc. Make any food you want - if it is really good, give me some. Make coffee there in the morning - always available -- you have your very own little coffee bar.

	• Very large living area, Real Fireplace, WiFi, Surround sound HDTV with HDMI hook-up and Roku TV, Bose sound system with iPhone/iPod hook-up, the best choice in music (in my opinion, most not consulted). Sit.... Enjoy

	• Large dining area - seats lots, great views over the city and over the Williamsburg Bridge. Eat foods mentioned above (probably while seated, although one can never be sure).

	• Natural brick walls (as opposed to unnatural I suppose) and a lovely Merbeau wooden floor, both of which look good (but do not say much).

	• Floor to ceiling windows throughout - bathed in sun (when the sun is out, mainly, of course)

	• Outside secluded seating area and balcony - you access directly from your room - very secluded (sometimes I cannot find it)

	• Full air conditioning / heating in the room and in rest of loft - be hot, be cool (most likely one at a time)

	• Bosch Washer and Dryer - for you to use - we like to reserve that for guests who stay for 3 nights or longer - being kind to the world too, we try to use cold water as well where possible.

	• Keyed Private elevator entrance directly into Loft - of course you have your own key (or stairs if u have the energy - does not seem so popular, strangely)

	• Printer / Scanner available. Pens and paper too, if you are a traditionalist.(although we draw the line at camel hair brushes, I am sure you understand). And there is a universal power adapter for you to use to charge your gadgets too.

	• The building is a very smart development, a recently renovated 7-story apartment block with original brick facade, great views of the city skyline. Quiet, lovely, village feel, with parks and pedestrian areas just outside, but close enough to get anywhere very easily. I think I am allowed to say it is authentic.

	• This is a very large and comfortable space that you will be free to enjoy as you wish (this is your vacation after all). You will have lots of privacy and as well as the city, you have Books, Music (great as mentioned above), Roku TV with lots of channels and an online DVR and more .... or just relax and chat. Up to you. We provide the following publications too

	New York Times
	New York Magazine

	so you can feel a bit like a New Yorker

	• Located in the heart of Downtown - food (some of the best in the city), drink, fun, shopping all very, very close. A very cool residential neighborhood just a short trip to all the action. Perfect location for exploring both sides of the river too, as very close to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. One of the most historic neighborhoods in the U.S. (perhaps the most). We are only a few minutes away from the walkway along the East River, it has a great view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan Bridge. Nearly opposite the Tenement Museum (which is really great). TV, Film and general interest media all the time (become a star - or an extra anyway) ,music clubs and comedy left right and center and Alphabet City, Ludlow Street , East Village, Chinatown and Soho all in spitting distance - and I can not spit far. Direct Access to cabs just outside building.

	• Food shopping wise, it is 3 blocks from a Whole Foods and a couple of blocks from the Essex Street Market. Great food shopping if you want.

	I hope everything is covered - email if you need more information. I hope to see you soon and I hope I can be part of your visit to this unique place.',
	'Guest access

	Guests have access to all they want - the rest of the Loft , the eat-in kitchen, the dining room, living room, their own private bathroom and bedroom of course and the back deck (hanging from rooftop negotiable) Enjoy.',
	'Interaction with guests

	As much or as little as you like. A detailed analysis of the days adventures or limited to semaphore and sign language -- you choose. Of course, ask us as many questions as you would like about what to see and do in New York (We love to talk about that!)',
	'Other things to note

	FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

	Some answers to some common questions asked by prospective guests:

	• My calendar is ALWAYS updated, so if the apartment is listed as available, then it is. I work hard to make sure that all my information is as accurate and clear as is possible. If you could try to make sure you read the entire listing as it not only answers most questions, but also makes the stay here much more enjoyable - as I have found in my time welcoming many many guests from all over the world.

	• If you are getting here early or late, I am happy to accommodate. If you get here early, for example (before the room is ready at 3 pm), you will be able to check in, get the keys, and leave your bags and enjoy the city and the room will be available at the check in time - if the room is ready earlier I will of course inform you. This works for when you are leaving too, for example if you flight takes off late. In this case I am happy to have you leave your bags and take the keys and return simply to pick up the bags to get to the airport or train station etc on time. It is all part of the service with no charge so you dont have to pay to store stuff, lug it around with you and you get chance to enjoy the city till the last moment.

	• Once you enter the dates and number of guests, AirBnb will give you an accurate price and show all costs including AirBnb fees. If you want to see how the total is calculated, the area on the right of the screen under the pictures shows the total and will detail what the breakdown is - you can get access to this easily via drop-down next to the total price, giving you a clear picture of all that you will be charged.

	• I do not give preset weekly discounts but, if you are planning to stay for a longish time, I am prepared to offer special prices, so please do email and ask.

	• I never charge for cleaning (unless you specifically want me to, of course). I think this a little unfair and the place is always kept very very clean.

	• You will have lots of privacy, I sleep in a area of the Loft with a separate bathroom and entertainment area. You will not keep me awake, nor will you need to tip-toe around. You effectively have a private apartment, but with a great guide to the city right there, to make sure that you can get tips and tricks from a local about things to do during your stay, making sure you can you explore NY properly, know hidden places to visit and the best and most up to date places to go (and dare I say it avoid all traps that await the tourist)

	• I have recently made the loft available to more guests than the 2 we usually have staying in the Queen Bed in the guest bedroom - previous guests have told me that they would love to bring friends or children with them and having stayed here, they said that the place is more than comfortable and spacious enough to do so.

	I have therefore added the use of the Queen size sofa-bed, together with the use of one of our two (depending what size you want) top-notch Airbeds that we have used in the past (to popular acclaim), both of which I have been told are extremely comfortable. The sofa-bed etc will be screened off to make it as a separate bedroom and there is enough space in the loft so that you can decide where to put either of the airbeds. The site makes this clear with simple icons that show you options for use of beds, but if there are any questions please ask.

	I have made the price for these extra beds (sofa-bed or the air-bed) substantially lower than the bedroom and, if you do wish to use them, the pricing for and reservation of them will be automatic (for example if you specify 3 or more people, that third person will be taking the sofa bed).

	NOTE: It will be assumed that, if there are 2 people staying, they will be sharing the bed in the bedroom. If there are 3, 4 or 5 people staying, it will be assumed that there will be two people to each bed -- if either of these are NOT the case please let me know as this means that we will need to use more beds and there will a small incremental charges for this, primarily for extra time setting up and for usage of sheets, washing etc . I am however always happy to discuss exactly what you need , via an email or two, to make it work.

	I urge you to contact me before you book , if you are not clear about anything or there are any questions that you have that you do feel are not covered.

	See you soon, I hope.',

	My friend and I landed at JFK at 11pm - but Carol was super accommodating and stayed up late to let us in. The apartment is beautiful and super clean. It was spacious, bright and Carol and Matt were both super friendly and fun to chat to - which is a bonus. The location of the apartment is also great, with much happening (especially and most importantly regarding the food scene). I would definitely stay here again and recommend the spot to everyone else. Thanks for helping make a great trip even better!',

	My daughter and I just returned from staying with Carol and Marc. From beginning to end it was a perfect experience. We felt safe and well taken care of. Carol gave us perfect instructions how to go places and got us comfortable with navigating the subway. Their home is comfortable, clean and inviting. Marc has lots of information and great stories. My daughter and I loved sharing a glass of wine with them at night and chatting. Beautiful, cultured, kind people. You will enjoy your stay here. We will miss them.',

	Pretty new to AirBNB but really happy with this first experience and hosts. They were super nice and friendly. The location was perfect; convenience of subway stations and nice little spots to check out for midnight snacks. The room was set up with many necessities for our arrival and we appreciated it very much. Would def book a stay at this place again. :)',

	Jeff and Jessicas place was perfection-- a more than fair price for an excellent location and cozy accommodations in an adorable apartment. Highlights include a very friendly, quiet dog and tons of trader joes products. Jessica was friendly and welcoming. It is funny that even in a small place it felt like we had tons of privacy.',

	Overall all good experience- we’ve been to Manhattan many times before and wanted to stay uptown to explore and do something different... but I will say that we slightly regretted it because it is quite far uptown. Jeff and Jessica were very friendly!!',

	'A ground floor apartment right next to Central Park & Morningside Park the flat is great for those who want a quick trip to the main tourist destinations but enjoy the quick access to parks and tranquil (and huge!) terrace.
	You’ll love my place because of the open floor plan of the apartment, exposed brick walls, tall barrel ceilings, and spacious terrace. Bedroom and bathroom are private towards the terrace side of the house. If you like dogs your in for a treat with Mowgli, my Siberian Husky.',
	'The space

	All check ins will be done through lock box to eliminate timing issues and delays. The key will be available after 3pm unless early check in is requested. Please see lock box details after booking.

	Check out is at 11am. Check in is at 3pm. Please do send flight details and estimated time of arrival to ease the check in process.

	- It is a basement apartment that still gets a lot of light with 3 windows through the main space, 2 in the front room and 3 in the back room (the one for rent) that looks out onto the terrace.
	- Exposed brick and high barrel ceilings make the space really cool and wide open from the front door to the back hallway
	-The bathrooms are very nice and modern. The bathroom included is private for just you with a bathtub/shower and single sink. All towels are included (2) and there are large supply shampoo and soap.
	- The bedroom has 3 windows, a double bed, one closet and a chest of drawers for storage. (Sept 2018: Brand new Parachute bedding and Onsen luxury towels)
	- The living room is outfitted with a leather Room & Board couch and a 60” TV that has connection to Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Hulu. There is also a sound-bar and Apple wifi network to enjoy fast wifi and bluetooth music
	- The kitchen is outfitting with stainless steel appliances, marble countertops, plates and cups for both inside and alfresco dining. There is also a washer/dryer combination unit in the kitchen although I would recommend the communal dryers for the building.
	- The best for last! On the terrace there are quite a few amenities. Theres a sectional couch that can seat up to 6 people, two chaise lounges, a 8 person dining table, a BBQ, and two umbrellas for shade during the day. Lots of plants and good lighting for the night as well. The terrace is definitely yours to enjoy and if you would like to have a few friends over no problem, please just no parties or late night noise, as well as cleaning up would be greatly appreciated.
	- The entrance is the only odd part about the flat, generally in New York there are main stairs to enter the building, our door is actually under those stairs.

	*NOTE AS WINTER IS COMING, TERRACE MAY NOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL*',

	There is not much beyond five starts that needs to be said. Yoni, Matthew and Oreo are great hosts. Their home is a home; it is lived in and it has the personal touches that screams "someone lives here" while also being tidy, warm and comfortable. I could make any number of tiny complaints that would be personal to me and being in a city far from home and a bed that is not mine, but really those are specific to each person and has no bearing on the space. I absolutely loved staying here and would do so again in a heartbeat. Yoni and Matthew really go above and beyond, communicate well, and make this a fantastic stay. Thank you again!',

	'Location, location, location! Large, classy, timeless, comfortable, entire top floor with private entrance in our private house out of a 1890s novel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn one block from the East River. So easy to get to Manhattan by subway, ferry, cab or even foot, and all the best places in the Burg Wifi/cableTV/air/heat.
	(We stay in our separate floor below you never compromising your privacy!)',

	'The space

	Perfect location on the Northside Williamsburg, Brooklyn Waterfront scene, my place is a wood beamed classic, with hard wood floors and restored original brick wall. It is the top floor of a 1894 restored house on a very nice semi residential street block. The nicely outfitted place, "the country in the sky" as I refer to it, has a beautiful totally functional "Peerless" antique prewar stove for cooking, generous amounts of pots, a wood burning fire place and a full size refrigerator in the kitchen. The feelings are cozy, warm, cabin like yet elegant. The kitchen and living room are in the same open area. There is a dining room table that seats 4, a beautiful brand new couch that folds down to become a very comfortable queen size bed that sleeps 2. Beyond the living area is the large master bedroom with a queen size bed that sleeps 2 with a large antique dresser and 2 riverside windows. Off the master bedroom is a large tiled classic bathroom with an antique skylight and large tub with shower, and a small bedroom with a twin size bed and riverside window that is nice as a separate rest area, a great place for a child to sleep, or an out of sight room to put your luggage and things.
	My location is beyond great and safe. 10 minutes maximum in a cab or car service over the Williamsburg Bridge and you are in Manhattan. It is a short walk (3 min) to the North 6th Street East River Ferry ( the scenic quick river route to Midtown Manhattan or lower Manhattan, please check schedules). Subways: L train ( gray line): First stop in Brooklyn, only one stop to Manhattan and a neat 10 minute walk from my place going by shops, restaurants and street vendors to the very frequent Northside L train subway stop at Bedford Ave and North 7 St, (Everything you want to pick up to take back to my place is on Bedford Ave or Kent Avenue which are the walking routes to the subway. (Among the small shops, restaurants and bars, there is now a "Whole Foods" supermarket and a Iphone store on Bedford!) The JM subway that goes over the Williamsburg Bridge with wonderful views of the river and NYC skyline to lower Manhattan (Chinatown etc), is a little further (13 min walk ) through the South Side. After a night out in the neighborhood, you will find this quiet, comfortable, timeless place to come home to that is the top floor of a restored Williamsburg house. All East River parks are a short walk away with their spectacular river and skyline views. During the warm months the weekend flea/food markets down Kent Avenue/North 8 on weekends are fun and back dropped by the river and Manhattan skyline. Grand Street River Park is only a block and a half away. I love going there in the mornings with a cup of tea and taking in the NYC view. The quaint restaurants and music clubs are amazing and abundant, the Williamsburg Foodtown Market has all the groceries you need and frankly the only reason I would leave the Burg would be to go to a museum, St. Patrick''s, Grand Central''s Oyster Bar or ice skating at Rockerfeller Center. Indoor Flea Market on North 7th right off Kent Ave, Mast Brothers Chocolate on North 3rd off Berry, Beer Garden restaurant lunch, dinner, brunch with live music on Friday nights on North 3rd and Berry, Sea restaurant (Thai) on North 6, Sweet Water (Bistro) restaurant on North 6, Dumont Burger for awesome burgers on Bedford between South 2-3,
	Aurora (Northern Italian) with great brunches, lunches and dinners is right around the corner as is Coxleys sport bar with 40 beers on tap and great chicken wings on Grand St. Teddys rest and bar (American Bistro) on North 8, a landmark that serves brunch, lunch and dinner and also has music sometimes at night, and the Knitting Factory music performance space and bar is 6 blocks away on Metropolitan. The best NY steak house, Peter Lugers reservations only, is in the vicinity.

	The floor is divided in 4 areas: upon entering you are in the kitchen and living, dining room with a wall and door that separates this space from the large bedroom in the front, the large tiled bathroom and the smaller front bedroom. The living area can easily convert to a sleeping area for 2. The place is adorable and sleeps four comfortably. Much quieter than most places in the area. Heat, air conditioning, wifi, fine linens/towels and kitchen utensils are provided for my guest.
	Full laundry drop off service and dry cleaners is available a couple of blocks up the street at Berry Cleaners or 302 Bedford Ave. My personal assistant/butler and I will check with you on your arrival time, hand over keys and be close at hand for anything you need during your stay. I and my husband are on our private lower floor of the house.',
	'Guest access

	The Country is an entire floor with private entrance and extremely well equipped, in a house owned by my husband and I. Please be considerate of noise in hallway and stairwell. Do not smoke or go out on fire escape. Wifi is included and of course help yourselves to my spices, tea, coffee, anything in the refrigerator, and feel free to browse through my lovely books.',

Anything at all that you are not sure about, if you are new to Airbnb for example, just ask and I will get back asap and clarify.

	• Very spacious loft apartment ( about 2000 sq feet, 188 sq m, at last measure - so very BIG for New York) in the center of arguably the coolest area of the city (please do not argue ), modern, minimalist furniture , very open, very clean, I take great pride in having a spotless living environment (that goes for the host too). A Massive space that gets flooded with light via a wall of windows. Just take a look at the pictures. High security. Walking distance to subways & museums. Friendly building and very safe neighborhood.

	• Your own PRIVATE bathroom - Large, spacious, with Jacuzzi Bath, Shower, Hairdryer, Kohler fixtures. Fresh towels etc. Fully-stocked. All the shampoo and things you will ever need. Just for you.

	• Your own PRIVATE bedroom - Queen Bed for 2, firm and soft pillows for every type of sleeper, linens, towels, Large Flat Screen TV, Netflix, Amazon TV etc, Wardrobe. Again only for you.

	• Large kitchen - Open concept with an area to eat and with everything you need to design a gourmet feast, top of the line GE appliances, Microwave, Toaster, Kettle , Dishwasher, stainless steel counter top etc. Make any food you want - if it is really good, give me some. Make coffee there in the morning - always available -- you have your very own little coffee bar.

	• Very large living area, Real Fireplace, WiFi, Surround sound HDTV with HDMI hook-up and Roku TV, Bose sound system with iPhone/iPod hook-up, the best choice in music (in my opinion, most not consulted). Sit.... Enjoy

	• Large dining area - seats lots, great views over the city and over the Williamsburg Bridge. Eat foods mentioned above (probably while seated, although one can never be sure).

	• Natural brick walls (as opposed to unnatural I suppose) and a lovely Merbeau wooden floor, both of which look good (but do not say much).

	• Floor to ceiling windows throughout - bathed in sun (when the sun is out, mainly, of course)

	• Outside secluded seating area and balcony - you access directly from your room - very secluded (sometimes I cannot find it)

	• Full air conditioning / heating in the room and in rest of loft - be hot, be cool (most likely one at a time)

	• Bosch Washer and Dryer - for you to use - we like to reserve that for guests who stay for 3 nights or longer - being kind to the world too, we try to use cold water as well where possible.

	• Keyed Private elevator entrance directly into Loft - of course you have your own key (or stairs if u have the energy - does not seem so popular, strangely)

	• Printer / Scanner available. Pens and paper too, if you are a traditionalist.(although we draw the line at camel hair brushes, I am sure you understand). And there is a universal power adapter for you to use to charge your gadgets too.

	• The building is a very smart development, a recently renovated 7-story apartment block with original brick facade, great views of the city skyline. Quiet, lovely, village feel, with parks and pedestrian areas just outside, but close enough to get anywhere very easily. I think I am allowed to say it is authentic.

	• This is a very large and comfortable space that you will be free to enjoy as you wish (this is your vacation after all). You will have lots of privacy and as well as the city, you have Books, Music (great as mentioned above), Roku TV with lots of channels and an online DVR and more .... or just relax and chat. Up to you. We provide the following publications too

	New York Times
	New York Magazine

	so you can feel a bit like a New Yorker

	• Located in the heart of Downtown - food (some of the best in the city), drink, fun, shopping all very, very close. A very cool residential neighborhood just a short trip to all the action. Perfect location for exploring both sides of the river too, as very close to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. One of the most historic neighborhoods in the U.S. (perhaps the most). We are only a few minutes away from the walkway along the East River, it has a great view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan Bridge. Nearly opposite the Tenement Museum (which is really great). TV, Film and general interest media all the time (become a star - or an extra anyway) ,music clubs and comedy left right and center and Alphabet City, Ludlow Street , East Village, Chinatown and Soho all in spitting distance - and I can not spit far. Direct Access to cabs just outside building.

	• Food shopping wise, it is 3 blocks from a Whole Foods and a couple of blocks from the Essex Street Market. Great food shopping if you want.

	I hope everything is covered - email if you need more information. I hope to see you soon and I hope I can be part of your visit to this unique place.',
	'Guest access

	Guests have access to all they want - the rest of the Loft , the eat-in kitchen, the dining room, living room, their own private bathroom and bedroom of course and the back deck (hanging from rooftop negotiable) Enjoy.',

	'Other things to note

	FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

	Some answers to some common questions asked by prospective guests:

	• My calendar is ALWAYS updated, so if the apartment is listed as available, then it is. I work hard to make sure that all my information is as accurate and clear as is possible. If you could try to make sure you read the entire listing as it not only answers most questions, but also makes the stay here much more enjoyable - as I have found in my time welcoming many many guests from all over the world.

	• If you are getting here early or late, I am happy to accommodate. If you get here early, for example (before the room is ready at 3 pm), you will be able to check in, get the keys, and leave your bags and enjoy the city and the room will be available at the check in time - if the room is ready earlier I will of course inform you. This works for when you are leaving too, for example if you flight takes off late. In this case I am happy to have you leave your bags and take the keys and return simply to pick up the bags to get to the airport or train station etc on time. It is all part of the service with no charge so you dont have to pay to store stuff, lug it around with you and you get chance to enjoy the city till the last moment.

	• Once you enter the dates and number of guests, AirBnb will give you an accurate price and show all costs including AirBnb fees. If you want to see how the total is calculated, the area on the right of the screen under the pictures shows the total and will detail what the breakdown is - you can get access to this easily via drop-down next to the total price, giving you a clear picture of all that you will be charged.

	• I do not give preset weekly discounts but, if you are planning to stay for a longish time, I am prepared to offer special prices, so please do email and ask.

	• I never charge for cleaning (unless you specifically want me to, of course). I think this a little unfair and the place is always kept very very clean.

	• You will have lots of privacy, I sleep in a area of the Loft with a separate bathroom and entertainment area. You will not keep me awake, nor will you need to tip-toe around. You effectively have a private apartment, but with a great guide to the city right there, to make sure that you can get tips and tricks from a local about things to do during your stay, making sure you can you explore NY properly, know hidden places to visit and the best and most up to date places to go (and dare I say it avoid all traps that await the tourist)

	• I have recently made the loft available to more guests than the 2 we usually have staying in the Queen Bed in the guest bedroom - previous guests have told me that they would love to bring friends or children with them and having stayed here, they said that the place is more than comfortable and spacious enough to do so.

	I have therefore added the use of the Queen size sofa-bed, together with the use of one of our two (depending what size you want) top-notch Airbeds that we have used in the past (to popular acclaim), both of which I have been told are extremely comfortable. The sofa-bed etc will be screened off to make it as a separate bedroom and there is enough space in the loft so that you can decide where to put either of the airbeds. The site makes this clear with simple icons that show you options for use of beds, but if there are any questions please ask.

	I have made the price for these extra beds (sofa-bed or the air-bed) substantially lower than the bedroom and, if you do wish to use them, the pricing for and reservation of them will be automatic (for example if you specify 3 or more people, that third person will be taking the sofa bed).

	NOTE: It will be assumed that, if there are 2 people staying, they will be sharing the bed in the bedroom. If there are 3, 4 or 5 people staying, it will be assumed that there will be two people to each bed -- if either of these are NOT the case please let me know as this means that we will need to use more beds and there will a small incremental charges for this, primarily for extra time setting up and for usage of sheets, washing etc . I am however always happy to discuss exactly what you need , via an email or two, to make it work.

	I urge you to contact me before you book , if you are not clear about anything or there are any questions that you have that you do feel are not covered.

	See you soon, I hope.',

	My friend and I landed at JFK at 11pm - but Carol was super accommodating and stayed up late to let us in. The apartment is beautiful and super clean. It was spacious, bright and Carol and Matt were both super friendly and fun to chat to - which is a bonus. The location of the apartment is also great, with much happening (especially and most importantly regarding the food scene). I would definitely stay here again and recommend the spot to everyone else. Thanks for helping make a great trip even better!',

	My daughter and I just returned from staying with Carol and Marc. From beginning to end it was a perfect experience. We felt safe and well taken care of. Carol gave us perfect instructions how to go places and got us comfortable with navigating the subway. Their home is comfortable, clean and inviting. Marc has lots of information and great stories. My daughter and I loved sharing a glass of wine with them at night and chatting. Beautiful, cultured, kind people. You will enjoy your stay here. We will miss them.',

	You’ll love my place because of the open floor plan of the apartment, exposed brick walls, tall barrel ceilings, and spacious terrace. Bedroom and bathroom are private towards the terrace side of the house. If you like dogs your in for a treat with Mowgli, my Siberian Husky.',
	'The space

	All check ins will be done through lock box to eliminate timing issues and delays. The key will be available after 3pm unless early check in is requested. Please see lock box details after booking.

	Check out is at 11am. Check in is at 3pm. Please do send flight details and estimated time of arrival to ease the check in process.

	- It is a basement apartment that still gets a lot of light with 3 windows through the main space, 2 in the front room and 3 in the back room (the one for rent) that looks out onto the terrace.
	- Exposed brick and high barrel ceilings make the space really cool and wide open from the front door to the back hallway
	-The bathrooms are very nice and modern. The bathroom included is private for just you with a bathtub/shower and single sink. All towels are included (2) and there are large supply shampoo and soap.
	- The bedroom has 3 windows, a double bed, one closet and a chest of drawers for storage. (Sept 2018: Brand new Parachute bedding and Onsen luxury towels)
	- The living room is outfitted with a leather Room & Board couch and a 60” TV that has connection to Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Hulu. There is also a sound-bar and Apple wifi network to enjoy fast wifi and bluetooth music
	- The kitchen is outfitting with stainless steel appliances, marble countertops, plates and cups for both inside and alfresco dining. There is also a washer/dryer combination unit in the kitchen although I would recommend the communal dryers for the building.
	- The best for last! On the terrace there are quite a few amenities. Theres a sectional couch that can seat up to 6 people, two chaise lounges, a 8 person dining table, a BBQ, and two umbrellas for shade during the day. Lots of plants and good lighting for the night as well. The terrace is definitely yours to enjoy and if you would like to have a few friends over no problem, please just no parties or late night noise, as well as cleaning up would be greatly appreciated.
	- The entrance is the only odd part about the flat, generally in New York there are main stairs to enter the building, our door is actually under those stairs.

	Incredibly convenient, clean, and Yoni was absolutely awesome. There is a subway station at the end of the block, there are places to eat within walking distance, and I felt safe in the neighborhood. His place is very clean and he offered everything that is listed. This was my first solo trip and having his insights into the city and comfortable living space made me feel at ease. It was easy check in and check out. I highly recommend this place if you are traveling to New York.',

	I enjoyed staying at this place. He was very responsive, quick to answer my questions. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and his apartment is very quiet for Manhattan. There are a lot of great restaurants and attractions in the neighborhood. A subway stop is very close by. Literally, at the end of the block you will find a stop with two major lines. Yoni is kind and gave me all the space I need. His dog, Oreo, is adorable. I recommend.',

	There is not much beyond five starts that needs to be said. Yoni, Matthew and Oreo are great hosts. Their home is a home; it is lived in and it has the personal touches that screams "someone lives here" while also being tidy, warm and comfortable. I could make any number of tiny complaints that would be personal to me and being in a city far from home and a bed that is not mine, but really those are specific to each person and has no bearing on the space. I absolutely loved staying here and would do so again in a heartbeat. Yoni and Matthew really go above and beyond, communicate well, and make this a fantastic stay. Thank you again!',

	'Location, location, location! Large, classy, timeless, comfortable, entire top floor with private entrance in our private house out of a 1890s novel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn one block from the East River. So easy to get to Manhattan by subway, ferry, cab or even foot, and all the best places in the Burg Wifi/cableTV/air/heat.
	(We stay in our separate floor below you never compromising your privacy!)',

	'The space

	Perfect location on the Northside Williamsburg, Brooklyn Waterfront scene, my place is a wood beamed classic, with hard wood floors and restored original brick wall. It is the top floor of a 1894 restored house on a very nice semi residential street block. The nicely outfitted place, "the country in the sky" as I refer to it, has a beautiful totally functional "Peerless" antique prewar stove for cooking, generous amounts of pots, a wood burning fire place and a full size refrigerator in the kitchen. The feelings are cozy, warm, cabin like yet elegant. The kitchen and living room are in the same open area. There is a dining room table that seats 4, a beautiful brand new couch that folds down to become a very comfortable queen size bed that sleeps 2. Beyond the living area is the large master bedroom with a queen size bed that sleeps 2 with a large antique dresser and 2 riverside windows. Off the master bedroom is a large tiled classic bathroom with an antique skylight and large tub with shower, and a small bedroom with a twin size bed and riverside window that is nice as a separate rest area, a great place for a child to sleep, or an out of sight room to put your luggage and things.
	My location is beyond great and safe. 10 minutes maximum in a cab or car service over the Williamsburg Bridge and you are in Manhattan. It is a short walk (3 min) to the North 6th Street East River Ferry ( the scenic quick river route to Midtown Manhattan or lower Manhattan, please check schedules). Subways: L train ( gray line): First stop in Brooklyn, only one stop to Manhattan and a neat 10 minute walk from my place going by shops, restaurants and street vendors to the very frequent Northside L train subway stop at Bedford Ave and North 7 St, (Everything you want to pick up to take back to my place is on Bedford Ave or Kent Avenue which are the walking routes to the subway. (Among the small shops, restaurants and bars, there is now a "Whole Foods" supermarket and a Iphone store on Bedford!) The JM subway that goes over the Williamsburg Bridge with wonderful views of the river and NYC skyline to lower Manhattan (Chinatown etc), is a little further (13 min walk ) through the South Side. After a night out in the neighborhood, you will find this quiet, comfortable, timeless place to come home to that is the top floor of a restored Williamsburg house. All East River parks are a short walk away with their spectacular river and skyline views. During the warm months the weekend flea/food markets down Kent Avenue/North 8 on weekends are fun and back dropped by the river and Manhattan skyline. Grand Street River Park is only a block and a half away. I love going there in the mornings with a cup of tea and taking in the NYC view. The quaint restaurants and music clubs are amazing and abundant, the Williamsburg Foodtown Market has all the groceries you need and frankly the only reason I would leave the Burg would be to go to a museum, St. Patrick''s, Grand Central''s Oyster Bar or ice skating at Rockerfeller Center. Indoor Flea Market on North 7th right off Kent Ave, Mast Brothers Chocolate on North 3rd off Berry, Beer Garden restaurant lunch, dinner, brunch with live music on Friday nights on North 3rd and Berry, Sea restaurant (Thai) on North 6, Sweet Water (Bistro) restaurant on North 6, Dumont Burger for awesome burgers on Bedford between South 2-3,
	Aurora (Northern Italian) with great brunches, lunches and dinners is right around the corner as is Coxleys sport bar with 40 beers on tap and great chicken wings on Grand St. Teddys rest and bar (American Bistro) on North 8, a landmark that serves brunch, lunch and dinner and also has music sometimes at night, and the Knitting Factory music performance space and bar is 6 blocks away on Metropolitan. The best NY steak house, Peter Lugers reservations only, is in the vicinity.

	The floor is divided in 4 areas: upon entering you are in the kitchen and living, dining room with a wall and door that separates this space from the large bedroom in the front, the large tiled bathroom and the smaller front bedroom. The living area can easily convert to a sleeping area for 2. The place is adorable and sleeps four comfortably. Much quieter than most places in the area. Heat, air conditioning, wifi, fine linens/towels and kitchen utensils are provided for my guest.
	Full laundry drop off service and dry cleaners is available a couple of blocks up the street at Berry Cleaners or 302 Bedford Ave. My personal assistant/butler and I will check with you on your arrival time, hand over keys and be close at hand for anything you need during your stay. I and my husband are on our private lower floor of the house.',
	'Guest access

	The Country is an entire floor with private entrance and extremely well equipped, in a house owned by my husband and I. Please be considerate of noise in hallway and stairwell.

	'The space

	Downtown Manhattan, .. just like you see it in the films. Only so much better in real life !!

	All the details are below so that will see all that you will experience on your trip to the Big Apple - there are lots of things you will love when you stay here, but PLEASE PLEASE (did I say please?) try to read all the way to the end of the description, including sleeping arrangements, information on the area, getting around and the frequently asked questions. I know it is a bit of a novel, but it is well worth it and, from experience, it makes sure you understand everything in detail and ensures you will have the best stay that you can. Anything at all that you are not sure about, if you are new to Airbnb for example, just ask and I will get back asap and clarify.

	• Very spacious loft apartment ( about 2000 sq feet, 188 sq m, at last measure - so very BIG for New York) in the center of arguably the coolest area of the city (please do not argue ), modern, minimalist furniture , very open, very clean, I take great pride in having a spotless living environment (that goes for the host too). A Massive space that gets flooded with light via a wall of windows. Just take a look at the pictures. High security. Walking distance to subways & museums. Friendly building and very safe neighborhood.

	• Your own PRIVATE bathroom - Large, spacious, with Jacuzzi Bath, Shower, Hairdryer, Kohler fixtures. Fresh towels etc. Fully-stocked. All the shampoo and things you will ever need. Just for you.

	• Your own PRIVATE bedroom - Queen Bed for 2, firm and soft pillows for every type of sleeper, linens, towels, Large Flat Screen TV, Netflix, Amazon TV etc, Wardrobe. Again only for you.

	• Large kitchen - Open concept with an area to eat and with everything you need to design a gourmet feast, top of the line GE appliances, Microwave, Toaster, Kettle , Dishwasher, stainless steel counter top etc. Make any food you want - if it is really good, give me some. Make coffee there in the morning - always available -- you have your very own little coffee bar.

	• Very large living area, Real Fireplace, WiFi, Surround sound HDTV with HDMI hook-up and Roku TV, Bose sound system with iPhone/iPod hook-up, the best choice in music (in my opinion, most not consulted). Sit.... Enjoy

	• Large dining area - seats lots, great views over the city and over the Williamsburg Bridge. Eat foods mentioned above (probably while seated, although one can never be sure).

	• Natural brick walls (as opposed to unnatural I suppose) and a lovely Merbeau wooden floor, both of which look good (but do not say much).

	• Floor to ceiling windows throughout - bathed in sun (when the sun is out, mainly, of course)

	• Outside secluded seating area and balcony - you access directly from your room - very secluded (sometimes I cannot find it)

	• Full air conditioning / heating in the room and in rest of loft - be hot, be cool (most likely one at a time)

	• Bosch Washer and Dryer - for you to use - we like to reserve that for guests who stay for 3 nights or longer - being kind to the world too, we try to use cold water as well where possible.

	• Keyed Private elevator entrance directly into Loft - of course you have your own key (or stairs if u have the energy - does not seem so popular, strangely)

	• Printer / Scanner available. Pens and paper too, if you are a traditionalist.(although we draw the line at camel hair brushes, I am sure you understand). And there is a universal power adapter for you to use to charge your gadgets too.

	• The building is a very smart development, a recently renovated 7-story apartment block with original brick facade, great views of the city skyline. Quiet, lovely, village feel, with parks and pedestrian areas just outside, but close enough to get anywhere very easily. I think I am allowed to say it is authentic.

	• This is a very large and comfortable space that you will be free to enjoy as you wish (this is your vacation after all). You will have lots of privacy and as well as the city, you have Books, Music (great as mentioned above), Roku TV with lots of channels and an online DVR and more .... or just relax and chat. Up to you. We provide the following publications too

	New York Times
	New York Magazine

	so you can feel a bit like a New Yorker

	• Located in the heart of Downtown - food (some of the best in the city), drink, fun, shopping all very, very close. A very cool residential neighborhood just a short trip to all the action. Perfect location for exploring both sides of the river too, as very close to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. One of the most historic neighborhoods in the U.S. (perhaps the most). We are only a few minutes away from the walkway along the East River, it has a great view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan Bridge. Nearly opposite the Tenement Museum (which is really great). TV, Film and general interest media all the time (become a star - or an extra anyway) ,music clubs and comedy left right and center and Alphabet City, Ludlow Street , East Village, Chinatown and Soho all in spitting distance - and I can not spit far. Direct Access to cabs just outside building.

	• Food shopping wise, it is 3 blocks from a Whole Foods and a couple of blocks from the Essex Street Market. Great food shopping if you want.

	I hope everything is covered - email if you need more information. I hope to see you soon and I hope I can be part of your visit to this unique place.',
	'Guest access

	Guests have access to all they want - the rest of the Loft , the eat-in kitchen, the dining room, living room, their own private bathroom and bedroom of course and the back deck (hanging from rooftop negotiable) Enjoy.',

	'Other things to note

	FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

	Some answers to some common questions asked by prospective guests:

	• My calendar is ALWAYS updated, so if the apartment is listed as available, then it is. I work hard to make sure that all my information is as accurate and clear as is possible. If you could try to make sure you read the entire listing as it not only answers most questions, but also makes the stay here much more enjoyable - as I have found in my time welcoming many many guests from all over the world.

	• If you are getting here early or late, I am happy to accommodate. If you get here early, for example (before the room is ready at 3 pm), you will be able to check in, get the keys, and leave your bags and enjoy the city and the room will be available at the check in time - if the room is ready earlier I will of course inform you. This works for when you are leaving too, for example if you flight takes off late. In this case I am happy to have you leave your bags and take the keys and return simply to pick up the bags to get to the airport or train station etc on time. It is all part of the service with no charge so you dont have to pay to store stuff, lug it around with you and you get chance to enjoy the city till the last moment.

	• Once you enter the dates and number of guests, AirBnb will give you an accurate price and show all costs including AirBnb fees. If you want to see how the total is calculated, the area on the right of the screen under the pictures shows the total and will detail what the breakdown is - you can get access to this easily via drop-down next to the total price, giving you a clear picture of all that you will be charged.

	• I do not give preset weekly discounts but, if you are planning to stay for a longish time, I am prepared to offer special prices, so please do email and ask.

	• I never charge for cleaning (unless you specifically want me to, of course). I think this a little unfair and the place is always kept very very clean.

	• You will have lots of privacy, I sleep in a area of the Loft with a separate bathroom and entertainment area. You will not keep me awake, nor will you need to tip-toe around. You effectively have a private apartment, but with a great guide to the city right there, to make sure that you can get tips and tricks from a local about things to do during your stay, making sure you can you explore NY properly, know hidden places to visit and the best and most up to date places to go (and dare I say it avoid all traps that await the tourist)

	• I have recently made the loft available to more guests than the 2 we usually have staying in the Queen Bed in the guest bedroom - previous guests have told me that they would love to bring friends or children with them and having stayed here, they said that the place is more than comfortable and spacious enough to do so.

	I have therefore added the use of the Queen size sofa-bed, together with the use of one of our two (depending what size you want) top-notch Airbeds that we have used in the past (to popular acclaim), both of which I have been told are extremely comfortable. The sofa-bed etc will be screened off to make it as a separate bedroom and there is enough space in the loft so that you can decide where to put either of the airbeds. The site makes this clear with simple icons that show you options for use of beds, but if there are any questions please ask.

	I have made the price for these extra beds (sofa-bed or the air-bed) substantially lower than the bedroom and, if you do wish to use them, the pricing for and reservation of them will be automatic (for example if you specify 3 or more people, that third person will be taking the sofa bed).

	NOTE: It will be assumed that, if there are 2 people staying, they will be sharing the bed in the bedroom. If there are 3, 4 or 5 people staying, it will be assumed that there will be two people to each bed -- if either of these are NOT the case please let me know as this means that we will need to use more beds and there will a small incremental charges for this, primarily for extra time setting up and for usage of sheets, washing etc . I am however always happy to discuss exactly what you need , via an email or two, to make it work.

	I urge you to contact me before you book , if you are not clear about anything or there are any questions that you have that you do feel are not covered.

	See you soon, I hope.',

	My friend and I landed at JFK at 11pm - but Carol was super accommodating and stayed up late to let us in. The apartment is beautiful and super clean. It was spacious, bright and Carol and Matt were both super friendly and fun to chat to - which is a bonus. The location of the apartment is also great, with much happening (especially and most importantly regarding the food scene). I would definitely stay here again and recommend the spot to everyone else. Thanks for helping make a great trip even better!',

Carol gave us perfect instructions how to go places and got us comfortable with navigating the subway. Their home is comfortable, clean and inviting. Marc has lots of information and great stories.

	'A ground floor apartment right next to Central Park & Morningside Park the flat is great for those who want a quick trip to the main tourist destinations but enjoy the quick access to parks and tranquil (and huge!) terrace.
	You’ll love my place because of the open floor plan of the apartment, exposed brick walls, tall barrel ceilings, and spacious terrace. Bedroom and bathroom are private towards the terrace side of the house. If you like dogs your in for a treat with Mowgli, my Siberian Husky.',
	'The space

	All check ins will be done through lock box to eliminate timing issues and delays. The key will be available after 3pm unless early check in is requested. Please see lock box details after booking.

	Check out is at 11am. Check in is at 3pm. Please do send flight details and estimated time of arrival to ease the check in process.

	- It is a basement apartment that still gets a lot of light with 3 windows through the main space, 2 in the front room and 3 in the back room (the one for rent) that looks out onto the terrace.
	- Exposed brick and high barrel ceilings make the space really cool and wide open from the front door to the back hallway
	-The bathrooms are very nice and modern. The bathroom included is private for just you with a bathtub/shower and single sink. All towels are included (2) and there are large supply shampoo and soap.
	- The bedroom has 3 windows, a double bed, one closet and a chest of drawers for storage. (Sept 2018: Brand new Parachute bedding and Onsen luxury towels)
	- The living room is outfitted with a leather Room & Board couch and a 60” TV that has connection to Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Hulu. There is also a sound-bar and Apple wifi network to enjoy fast wifi and bluetooth music
	- The kitchen is outfitting with stainless steel appliances, marble countertops, plates and cups for both inside and alfresco dining. There is also a washer/dryer combination unit in the kitchen although I would recommend the communal dryers for the building.
	- The best for last! On the terrace there are quite a few amenities. Theres a sectional couch that can seat up to 6 people, two chaise lounges, a 8 person dining table, a BBQ, and two umbrellas for shade during the day. Lots of plants and good lighting for the night as well. The terrace is definitely yours to enjoy and if you would like to have a few friends over no problem, please just no parties or late night noise, as well as cleaning up would be greatly appreciated.
	- The entrance is the only odd part about the flat, generally in New York there are main stairs to enter the building, our door is actually under those stairs.

	*NOTE AS WINTER IS COMING, TERRACE MAY NOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL*',

	There is not much beyond five starts that needs to be said. Yoni, Matthew and Oreo are great hosts. Their home is a home; it is lived in and it has the personal touches that screams "someone lives here" while also being tidy, warm and comfortable. I could make any number of tiny complaints that would be personal to me and being in a city far from home and a bed that is not mine, but really those are specific to each person and has no bearing on the space. I absolutely loved staying here and would do so again in a heartbeat. Yoni and Matthew really go above and beyond, communicate well, and make this a fantastic stay. Thank you again!',

	'Location, location, location! Large, classy, timeless, comfortable, entire top floor with private entrance in our private house out of a 1890s novel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn one block from the East River. So easy to get to Manhattan by subway, ferry, cab or even foot, and all the best places in the Burg Wifi/cableTV/air/heat.
	(We stay in our separate floor below you never compromising your privacy!)',

	'The space

	Perfect location on the Northside Williamsburg, Brooklyn Waterfront scene, my place is a wood beamed classic, with hard wood floors and restored original brick wall. It is the top floor of a 1894 restored house on a very nice semi residential street block. The nicely outfitted place, "the country in the sky" as I refer to it, has a beautiful totally functional "Peerless" antique prewar stove for cooking, generous amounts of pots, a wood burning fire place and a full size refrigerator in the kitchen. The feelings are cozy, warm, cabin like yet elegant. The kitchen and living room are in the same open area. There is a dining room table that seats 4, a beautiful brand new couch that folds down to become a very comfortable queen size bed that sleeps 2. Beyond the living area is the large master bedroom with a queen size bed that sleeps 2 with a large antique dresser and 2 riverside windows. Off the master bedroom is a large tiled classic bathroom with an antique skylight and large tub with shower, and a small bedroom with a twin size bed and riverside window that is nice as a separate rest area, a great place for a child to sleep, or an out of sight room to put your luggage and things.
	My location is beyond great and safe. 10 minutes maximum in a cab or car service over the Williamsburg Bridge and you are in Manhattan. It is a short walk (3 min) to the North 6th Street East River Ferry ( the scenic quick river route to Midtown Manhattan or lower Manhattan, please check schedules). Subways: L train ( gray line): First stop in Brooklyn, only one stop to Manhattan and a neat 10 minute walk from my place going by shops, restaurants and street vendors to the very frequent Northside L train subway stop at Bedford Ave and North 7 St, (Everything you want to pick up to take back to my place is on Bedford Ave or Kent Avenue which are the walking routes to the subway. (Among the small shops, restaurants and bars, there is now a "Whole Foods" supermarket and a Iphone store on Bedford!) The JM subway that goes over the Williamsburg Bridge with wonderful views of the river and NYC skyline to lower Manhattan (Chinatown etc), is a little further (13 min walk ) through the South Side. After a night out in the neighborhood, you will find this quiet, comfortable, timeless place to come home to that is the top floor of a restored Williamsburg house. All East River parks are a short walk away with their spectacular river and skyline views. During the warm months the weekend flea/food markets down Kent Avenue/North 8 on weekends are fun and back dropped by the river and Manhattan skyline. Grand Street River Park is only a block and a half away. I love going there in the mornings with a cup of tea and taking in the NYC view. The quaint restaurants and music clubs are amazing and abundant, the Williamsburg Foodtown Market has all the groceries you need and frankly the only reason I would leave the Burg would be to go to a museum, St. Patrick''s, Grand Central''s Oyster Bar or ice skating at Rockerfeller Center. Indoor Flea Market on North 7th right off Kent Ave, Mast Brothers Chocolate on North 3rd off Berry, Beer Garden restaurant lunch, dinner, brunch with live music on Friday nights on North 3rd and Berry, Sea restaurant (Thai) on North 6, Sweet Water (Bistro) restaurant on North 6, Dumont Burger for awesome burgers on Bedford between South 2-3,
	Aurora (Northern Italian) with great brunches, lunches and dinners is right around the corner as is Coxleys sport bar with 40 beers on tap and great chicken wings on Grand St. Teddys rest and bar (American Bistro) on North 8, a landmark that serves brunch, lunch and dinner and also has music sometimes at night, and the Knitting Factory music performance space and bar is 6 blocks away on Metropolitan. The best NY steak house, Peter Lugers reservations only, is in the vicinity.

	The floor is divided in 4 areas: upon entering you are in the kitchen and living, dining room with a wall and door that separates this space from the large bedroom in the front, the large tiled bathroom and the smaller front bedroom. The living area can easily convert to a sleeping area for 2. The place is adorable and sleeps four comfortably. Much quieter than most places in the area. Heat, air conditioning, wifi, fine linens/towels and kitchen utensils are provided for my guest.
	Full laundry drop off service and dry cleaners is available a couple of blocks up the street at Berry Cleaners or 302 Bedford Ave. My personal assistant/butler and I will check with you on your arrival time, hand over keys and be close at hand for anything you need during your stay. I and my husband are on our private lower floor of the house.',
	'Guest access

	The Country is an entire floor with private entrance and extremely well equipped, in a house owned by my husband and I. Please be considerate of noise in hallway and stairwell. Do not smoke or go out on fire escape. Wifi is included and of course help yourselves to my spices, tea, coffee, anything in the refrigerator, and feel free to browse through my lovely books.',

	Si, hablo bien espanol, Français parlé assez bien.',
	'The space

	Downtown Manhattan, .. just like you see it in the films. Only so much better in real life !!

	All the details are below so that will see all that you will experience on your trip to the Big Apple - there are lots of things you will love when you stay here, but PLEASE PLEASE (did I say please?) try to read all the way to the end of the description, including sleeping arrangements, information on the area, getting around and the frequently asked questions. I know it is a bit of a novel, but it is well worth it and, from experience, it makes sure you understand everything in detail and ensures you will have the best stay that you can. Anything at all that you are not sure about, if you are new to Airbnb for example, just ask and I will get back asap and clarify.

	• Very spacious loft apartment ( about 2000 sq feet, 188 sq m, at last measure - so very BIG for New York) in the center of arguably the coolest area of the city (please do not argue ), modern, minimalist furniture , very open, very clean, I take great pride in having a spotless living environment (that goes for the host too). A Massive space that gets flooded with light via a wall of windows. Just take a look at the pictures. High security. Walking distance to subways & museums. Friendly building and very safe neighborhood.

	• Your own PRIVATE bathroom - Large, spacious, with Jacuzzi Bath, Shower, Hairdryer, Kohler fixtures. Fresh towels etc. Fully-stocked. All the shampoo and things you will ever need. Just for you.

	• Your own PRIVATE bedroom - Queen Bed for 2, firm and soft pillows for every type of sleeper, linens, towels, Large Flat Screen TV, Netflix, Amazon TV etc, Wardrobe. Again only for you.

	• Large kitchen - Open concept with an area to eat and with everything you need to design a gourmet feast, top of the line GE appliances, Microwave, Toaster, Kettle , Dishwasher, stainless steel counter top etc. Make any food you want - if it is really good, give me some. Make coffee there in the morning - always available -- you have your very own little coffee bar.

	• Very large living area, Real Fireplace, WiFi, Surround sound HDTV with HDMI hook-up and Roku TV, Bose sound system with iPhone/iPod hook-up, the best choice in music (in my opinion, most not consulted). Sit.... Enjoy

	• Large dining area - seats lots, great views over the city and over the Williamsburg Bridge. Eat foods mentioned above (probably while seated, although one can never be sure).

	• Natural brick walls (as opposed to unnatural I suppose) and a lovely Merbeau wooden floor, both of which look good (but do not say much).

	• Floor to ceiling windows throughout - bathed in sun (when the sun is out, mainly, of course)

	• Outside secluded seating area and balcony - you access directly from your room - very secluded (sometimes I cannot find it)

	• Full air conditioning / heating in the room and in rest of loft - be hot, be cool (most likely one at a time)

	• Bosch Washer and Dryer - for you to use - we like to reserve that for guests who stay for 3 nights or longer - being kind to the world too, we try to use cold water as well where possible.

	• Keyed Private elevator entrance directly into Loft - of course you have your own key (or stairs if u have the energy - does not seem so popular, strangely)

	• Printer / Scanner available. Pens and paper too, if you are a traditionalist.(although we draw the line at camel hair brushes, I am sure you understand). And there is a universal power adapter for you to use to charge your gadgets too.

	• The building is a very smart development, a recently renovated 7-story apartment block with original brick facade, great views of the city skyline. Quiet, lovely, village feel, with parks and pedestrian areas just outside, but close enough to get anywhere very easily. I think I am allowed to say it is authentic.

	• This is a very large and comfortable space that you will be free to enjoy as you wish (this is your vacation after all). You will have lots of privacy and as well as the city, you have Books, Music (great as mentioned above), Roku TV with lots of channels and an online DVR and more .... or just relax and chat. Up to you. We provide the following publications too

	New York Times
	New York Magazine

	so you can feel a bit like a New Yorker

	• Located in the heart of Downtown - food (some of the best in the city), drink, fun, shopping all very, very close. A very cool residential neighborhood just a short trip to all the action. Perfect location for exploring both sides of the river too, as very close to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. One of the most historic neighborhoods in the U.S. (perhaps the most). We are only a few minutes away from the walkway along the East River, it has a great view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan Bridge. Nearly opposite the Tenement Museum (which is really great). TV, Film and general interest media all the time (become a star - or an extra anyway) ,music clubs and comedy left right and center and Alphabet City, Ludlow Street , East Village, Chinatown and Soho all in spitting distance - and I can not spit far. Direct Access to cabs just outside building.

	• Food shopping wise, it is 3 blocks from a Whole Foods and a couple of blocks from the Essex Street Market. Great food shopping if you want.

	I hope everything is covered - email if you need more information. I hope to see you soon and I hope I can be part of your visit to this unique place.',
	'Guest access

	Guests have access to all they want - the rest of the Loft , the eat-in kitchen, the dining room, living room, their own private bathroom and bedroom of course and the back deck (hanging from rooftop negotiable) Enjoy.',
	'Interaction with guests

	As much or as little as you like. A detailed analysis of the days adventures or limited to semaphore and sign language -- you choose. Of course, ask us as many questions as you would like about what to see and do in New York (We love to talk about that!)',
	'Other things to note

	FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

	Some answers to some common questions asked by prospective guests:

	• My calendar is ALWAYS updated, so if the apartment is listed as available, then it is. I work hard to make sure that all my information is as accurate and clear as is possible. If you could try to make sure you read the entire listing as it not only answers most questions, but also makes the stay here much more enjoyable - as I have found in my time welcoming many many guests from all over the world.

	• If you are getting here early or late, I am happy to accommodate. If you get here early, for example (before the room is ready at 3 pm), you will be able to check in, get the keys, and leave your bags and enjoy the city and the room will be available at the check in time - if the room is ready earlier I will of course inform you. This works for when you are leaving too, for example if you flight takes off late. In this case I am happy to have you leave your bags and take the keys and return simply to pick up the bags to get to the airport or train station etc on time. It is all part of the service with no charge so you dont have to pay to store stuff, lug it around with you and you get chance to enjoy the city till the last moment.

	• Once you enter the dates and number of guests, AirBnb will give you an accurate price and show all costs including AirBnb fees. If you want to see how the total is calculated, the area on the right of the screen under the pictures shows the total and will detail what the breakdown is - you can get access to this easily via drop-down next to the total price, giving you a clear picture of all that you will be charged.

	• I do not give preset weekly discounts but, if you are planning to stay for a longish time, I am prepared to offer special prices, so please do email and ask.

	• I never charge for cleaning (unless you specifically want me to, of course). I think this a little unfair and the place is always kept very very clean.

	• You will have lots of privacy, I sleep in a area of the Loft with a separate bathroom and entertainment area. You will not keep me awake, nor will you need to tip-toe around. You effectively have a private apartment, but with a great guide to the city right there, to make sure that you can get tips and tricks from a local about things to do during your stay, making sure you can you explore NY properly, know hidden places to visit and the best and most up to date places to go (and dare I say it avoid all traps that await the tourist)

	• I have recently made the loft available to more guests than the 2 we usually have staying in the Queen Bed in the guest bedroom - previous guests have told me that they would love to bring friends or children with them and having stayed here, they said that the place is more than comfortable and spacious enough to do so.

	I have therefore added the use of the Queen size sofa-bed, together with the use of one of our two (depending what size you want) top-notch Airbeds that we have used in the past (to popular acclaim), both of which I have been told are extremely comfortable. The sofa-bed etc will be screened off to make it as a separate bedroom and there is enough space in the loft so that you can decide where to put either of the airbeds. The site makes this clear with simple icons that show you options for use of beds, but if there are any questions please ask.

	I have made the price for these extra beds (sofa-bed or the air-bed) substantially lower than the bedroom and, if you do wish to use them, the pricing for and reservation of them will be automatic (for example if you specify 3 or more people, that third person will be taking the sofa bed).

	NOTE: It will be assumed that, if there are 2 people staying, they will be sharing the bed in the bedroom. If there are 3, 4 or 5 people staying, it will be assumed that there will be two people to each bed -- if either of these are NOT the case please let me know as this means that we will need to use more beds and there will a small incremental charges for this, primarily for extra time setting up and for usage of sheets, washing etc . I am however always happy to discuss exactly what you need , via an email or two, to make it work.

	I urge you to contact me before you book , if you are not clear about anything or there are any questions that you have that you do feel are not covered.

	See you soon, I hope.',

	My friend and I landed at JFK at 11pm - but Carol was super accommodating and stayed up late to let us in. The apartment is beautiful and super clean. It was spacious, bright and Carol and Matt were both super friendly and fun to chat to - which is a bonus. The location of the apartment is also great, with much happening (especially and most importantly regarding the food scene). I would definitely stay here again and recommend the spot to everyone else. Thanks for helping make a great trip even better!',

	My daughter and I just returned from staying with Carol and Marc. From beginning to end it was a perfect experience. We felt safe and well taken care of. Carol gave us perfect instructions how to go places and got us comfortable with navigating the subway. Their home is comfortable, clean and inviting. Marc has lots of information and great stories. My daughter and I loved sharing a glass of wine with them at night and chatting. Beautiful, cultured, kind people. You will enjoy your stay here. We will miss them.',

	Pretty new to AirBNB but really happy with this first experience and hosts. They were super nice and friendly. The location was perfect; convenience of subway stations and nice little spots to check out for midnight snacks. The room was set up with many necessities for our arrival and we appreciated it very much. Would def book a stay at this place again. :)',

	Jeff and Jessicas place was perfection-- a more than fair price for an excellent location and cozy accommodations in an adorable apartment. Highlights include a very friendly, quiet dog and tons of trader joes products. Jessica was friendly and welcoming. It is funny that even in a small place it felt like we had tons of privacy.',

	Overall all good experience- we’ve been to Manhattan many times before and wanted to stay uptown to explore and do something different... but I will say that we slightly regretted it because it is quite far uptown. Jeff and Jessica were very friendly!!',

	'A ground floor apartment right next to Central Park & Morningside Park the flat is great for those who want a quick trip to the main tourist destinations but enjoy the quick access to parks and tranquil (and huge!) terrace.
	You’ll love my place because of the open floor plan of the apartment, exposed brick walls, tall barrel ceilings, and spacious terrace. Bedroom and bathroom are private towards the terrace side of the house. If you like dogs your in for a treat with Mowgli, my Siberian Husky.',
	'The space

	All check ins will be done through lock box to eliminate timing issues and delays. The key will be available after 3pm unless early check in is requested. Please see lock box details after booking.

	Check out is at 11am. Check in is at 3pm. Please do send flight details and estimated time of arrival to ease the check in process.

	- It is a basement apartment that still gets a lot of light with 3 windows through the main space, 2 in the front room and 3 in the back room (the one for rent) that looks out onto the terrace.
	- Exposed brick and high barrel ceilings make the space really cool and wide open from the front door to the back hallway
	-The bathrooms are very nice and modern. The bathroom included is private for just you with a bathtub/shower and single sink. All towels are included (2) and there are large supply shampoo and soap.
	- The bedroom has 3 windows, a double bed, one closet and a chest of drawers for storage. (Sept 2018: Brand new Parachute bedding and Onsen luxury towels)
	- The living room is outfitted with a leather Room & Board couch and a 60” TV that has connection to Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Hulu. There is also a sound-bar and Apple wifi network to enjoy fast wifi and bluetooth music
	- The kitchen is outfitting with stainless steel appliances, marble countertops, plates and cups for both inside and alfresco dining. There is also a washer/dryer combination unit in the kitchen although I would recommend the communal dryers for the building.
	- The best for last! On the terrace there are quite a few amenities. Theres a sectional couch that can seat up to 6 people, two chaise lounges, a 8 person dining table, a BBQ, and two umbrellas for shade during the day. Lots of plants and good lighting for the night as well. The terrace is definitely yours to enjoy and if you would like to have a few friends over no problem, please just no parties or late night noise, as well as cleaning up would be greatly appreciated.
	- The entrance is the only odd part about the flat, generally in New York there are main stairs to enter the building, our door is actually under those stairs.

	*NOTE AS WINTER IS COMING, TERRACE MAY NOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL*',

The room is a great size for 2 people plus luggage. The apartment is very easily to get to via the subway which made exploring the city so convenient, and the neighborhood is quiet and safe!! Brook was a great host! This was our first Airbnb experience and he did a great job of making us feel at home rather than guest! He was easy to communicate with at all times and helped us with some recommendations around the city!',

	There is not much beyond five starts that needs to be said. Yoni, Matthew and Oreo are great hosts. Their home is a home; it is lived in and it has the personal touches that screams "someone lives here" while also being tidy, warm and comfortable. I could make any number of tiny complaints that would be personal to me and being in a city far from home and a bed that is not mine, but really those are specific to each person and has no bearing on the space. I absolutely loved staying here and would do so again in a heartbeat. Yoni and Matthew really go above and beyond, communicate well, and make this a fantastic stay. Thank you again!',

	'Location, location, location! Large, classy, timeless, comfortable, entire top floor with private entrance in our private house out of a 1890s novel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn one block from the East River. So easy to get to Manhattan by subway, ferry, cab or even foot, and all the best places in the Burg Wifi/cableTV/air/heat.
	(We stay in our separate floor below you never compromising your privacy!)',

	'The space

	Perfect location on the Northside Williamsburg, Brooklyn Waterfront scene, my place is a wood beamed classic, with hard wood floors and restored original brick wall. It is the top floor of a 1894 restored house on a very nice semi residential street block. The nicely outfitted place, "the country in the sky" as I refer to it, has a beautiful totally functional "Peerless" antique prewar stove for cooking, generous amounts of pots, a wood burning fire place and a full size refrigerator in the kitchen. The feelings are cozy, warm, cabin like yet elegant. The kitchen and living room are in the same open area. There is a dining room table that seats 4, a beautiful brand new couch that folds down to become a very comfortable queen size bed that sleeps 2. Beyond the living area is the large master bedroom with a queen size bed that sleeps 2 with a large antique dresser and 2 riverside windows. Off the master bedroom is a large tiled classic bathroom with an antique skylight and large tub with shower, and a small bedroom with a twin size bed and riverside window that is nice as a separate rest area, a great place for a child to sleep, or an out of sight room to put your luggage and things.
	My location is beyond great and safe. 10 minutes maximum in a cab or car service over the Williamsburg Bridge and you are in Manhattan. It is a short walk (3 min) to the North 6th Street East River Ferry ( the scenic quick river route to Midtown Manhattan or lower Manhattan, please check schedules). Subways: L train ( gray line): First stop in Brooklyn, only one stop to Manhattan and a neat 10 minute walk from my place going by shops, restaurants and street vendors to the very frequent Northside L train subway stop at Bedford Ave and North 7 St, (Everything you want to pick up to take back to my place is on Bedford Ave or Kent Avenue which are the walking routes to the subway. (Among the small shops, restaurants and bars, there is now a "Whole Foods" supermarket and a Iphone store on Bedford!) The JM subway that goes over the Williamsburg Bridge with wonderful views of the river and NYC skyline to lower Manhattan (Chinatown etc), is a little further (13 min walk ) through the South Side. After a night out in the neighborhood, you will find this quiet, comfortable, timeless place to come home to that is the top floor of a restored Williamsburg house. All East River parks are a short walk away with their spectacular river and skyline views. During the warm months the weekend flea/food markets down Kent Avenue/North 8 on weekends are fun and back dropped by the river and Manhattan skyline. Grand Street River Park is only a block and a half away. I love going there in the mornings with a cup of tea and taking in the NYC view. The quaint restaurants and music clubs are amazing and abundant, the Williamsburg Foodtown Market has all the groceries you need and frankly the only reason I would leave the Burg would be to go to a museum, St. Patrick''s, Grand Central''s Oyster Bar or ice skating at Rockerfeller Center. Indoor Flea Market on North 7th right off Kent Ave, Mast Brothers Chocolate on North 3rd off Berry, Beer Garden restaurant lunch, dinner, brunch with live music on Friday nights on North 3rd and Berry, Sea restaurant (Thai) on North 6, Sweet Water (Bistro) restaurant on North 6, Dumont Burger for awesome burgers on Bedford between South 2-3,
	Aurora (Northern Italian) with great brunches, lunches and dinners is right around the corner as is Coxleys sport bar with 40 beers on tap and great chicken wings on Grand St. Teddys rest and bar (American Bistro) on North 8, a landmark that serves brunch, lunch and dinner and also has music sometimes at night, and the Knitting Factory music performance space and bar is 6 blocks away on Metropolitan. The best NY steak house, Peter Lugers reservations only, is in the vicinity.

	The floor is divided in 4 areas: upon entering you are in the kitchen and living, dining room with a wall and door that separates this space from the large bedroom in the front, the large tiled bathroom and the smaller front bedroom. The living area can easily convert to a sleeping area for 2. The place is adorable and sleeps four comfortably. Much quieter than most places in the area. Heat, air conditioning, wifi, fine linens/towels and kitchen utensils are provided for my guest.
	Full laundry drop off service and dry cleaners is available a couple of blocks up the street at Berry Cleaners or 302 Bedford Ave. My personal assistant/butler and I will check with you on your arrival time, hand over keys and be close at hand for anything you need during your stay. I and my husband are on our private lower floor of the house.',

	The Country is an entire floor with private entrance and extremely well equipped, in a house owned by my husband and I. Please be considerate of noise in hallway and stairwell.

A Massive space that gets flooded with light via a wall of windows. Just take a look at the pictures. High security. Walking distance to subways & museums. Friendly building and very safe neighborhood.

	• Your own PRIVATE bathroom - Large, spacious, with Jacuzzi Bath, Shower, Hairdryer, Kohler fixtures. Fresh towels etc. Fully-stocked. All the shampoo and things you will ever need. Just for you.

	• Your own PRIVATE bedroom - Queen Bed for 2, firm and soft pillows for every type of sleeper, linens, towels, Large Flat Screen TV, Netflix, Amazon TV etc, Wardrobe. Again only for you.

	• Large kitchen - Open concept with an area to eat and with everything you need to design a gourmet feast, top of the line GE appliances, Microwave, Toaster, Kettle , Dishwasher, stainless steel counter top etc. Make any food you want - if it is really good, give me some. Make coffee there in the morning - always available -- you have your very own little coffee bar.

	• Very large living area, Real Fireplace, WiFi, Surround sound HDTV with HDMI hook-up and Roku TV, Bose sound system with iPhone/iPod hook-up, the best choice in music (in my opinion, most not consulted). Sit.... Enjoy

	• Large dining area - seats lots, great views over the city and over the Williamsburg Bridge. Eat foods mentioned above (probably while seated, although one can never be sure).

	• Natural brick walls (as opposed to unnatural I suppose) and a lovely Merbeau wooden floor, both of which look good (but do not say much).

	• Floor to ceiling windows throughout - bathed in sun (when the sun is out, mainly, of course)

	• Outside secluded seating area and balcony - you access directly from your room - very secluded (sometimes I cannot find it)

	• Full air conditioning / heating in the room and in rest of loft - be hot, be cool (most likely one at a time)

	• Bosch Washer and Dryer - for you to use - we like to reserve that for guests who stay for 3 nights or longer - being kind to the world too, we try to use cold water as well where possible.

	• Keyed Private elevator entrance directly into Loft - of course you have your own key (or stairs if u have the energy - does not seem so popular, strangely)

	• Printer / Scanner available. Pens and paper too, if you are a traditionalist.(although we draw the line at camel hair brushes, I am sure you understand). And there is a universal power adapter for you to use to charge your gadgets too.

	• The building is a very smart development, a recently renovated 7-story apartment block with original brick facade, great views of the city skyline. Quiet, lovely, village feel, with parks and pedestrian areas just outside, but close enough to get anywhere very easily. I think I am allowed to say it is authentic.

	• This is a very large and comfortable space that you will be free to enjoy as you wish (this is your vacation after all). You will have lots of privacy and as well as the city, you have Books, Music (great as mentioned above), Roku TV with lots of channels and an online DVR and more .... or just relax and chat. Up to you. We provide the following publications too

	New York Times
	New York Magazine

	so you can feel a bit like a New Yorker

	• Located in the heart of Downtown - food (some of the best in the city), drink, fun, shopping all very, very close. A very cool residential neighborhood just a short trip to all the action. Perfect location for exploring both sides of the river too, as very close to Brooklyn and Williamsburg. One of the most historic neighborhoods in the U.S. (perhaps the most). We are only a few minutes away from the walkway along the East River, it has a great view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan Bridge. Nearly opposite the Tenement Museum (which is really great). TV, Film and general interest media all the time (become a star - or an extra anyway) ,music clubs and comedy left right and center and Alphabet City, Ludlow Street , East Village, Chinatown and Soho all in spitting distance - and I can not spit far. Direct Access to cabs just outside building.

	• Food shopping wise, it is 3 blocks from a Whole Foods and a couple of blocks from the Essex Street Market. Great food shopping if you want.

	I hope everything is covered - email if you need more information. I hope to see you soon and I hope I can be part of your visit to this unique place.',
	'Guest access

	Guests have access to all they want - the rest of the Loft , the eat-in kitchen, the dining room, living room, their own private bathroom and bedroom of course and the back deck (hanging from rooftop negotiable) Enjoy.',

	'Other things to note

	FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

	Some answers to some common questions asked by prospective guests:

	• My calendar is ALWAYS updated, so if the apartment is listed as available, then it is. I work hard to make sure that all my information is as accurate and clear as is possible. If you could try to make sure you read the entire listing as it not only answers most questions, but also makes the stay here much more enjoyable - as I have found in my time welcoming many many guests from all over the world.

	• If you are getting here early or late, I am happy to accommodate. If you get here early, for example (before the room is ready at 3 pm), you will be able to check in, get the keys, and leave your bags and enjoy the city and the room will be available at the check in time - if the room is ready earlier I will of course inform you. This works for when you are leaving too, for example if you flight takes off late. In this case I am happy to have you leave your bags and take the keys and return simply to pick up the bags to get to the airport or train station etc on time. It is all part of the service with no charge so you dont have to pay to store stuff, lug it around with you and you get chance to enjoy the city till the last moment.

	• Once you enter the dates and number of guests, AirBnb will give you an accurate price and show all costs including AirBnb fees. If you want to see how the total is calculated, the area on the right of the screen under the pictures shows the total and will detail what the breakdown is - you can get access to this easily via drop-down next to the total price, giving you a clear picture of all that you will be charged.

	• I do not give preset weekly discounts but, if you are planning to stay for a longish time, I am prepared to offer special prices, so please do email and ask.

	• I never charge for cleaning (unless you specifically want me to, of course). I think this a little unfair and the place is always kept very very clean.

	• You will have lots of privacy, I sleep in a area of the Loft with a separate bathroom and entertainment area. You will not keep me awake, nor will you need to tip-toe around. You effectively have a private apartment, but with a great guide to the city right there, to make sure that you can get tips and tricks from a local about things to do during your stay, making sure you can you explore NY properly, know hidden places to visit and the best and most up to date places to go (and dare I say it avoid all traps that await the tourist)

	• I have recently made the loft available to more guests than the 2 we usually have staying in the Queen Bed in the guest bedroom - previous guests have told me that they would love to bring friends or children with them and having stayed here, they said that the place is more than comfortable and spacious enough to do so.

	I have therefore added the use of the Queen size sofa-bed, together with the use of one of our two (depending what size you want) top-notch Airbeds that we have used in the past (to popular acclaim), both of which I have been told are extremely comfortable. The sofa-bed etc will be screened off to make it as a separate bedroom and there is enough space in the loft so that you can decide where to put either of the airbeds. The site makes this clear with simple icons that show you options for use of beds, but if there are any questions please ask.

	I have made the price for these extra beds (sofa-bed or the air-bed) substantially lower than the bedroom and, if you do wish to use them, the pricing for and reservation of them will be automatic (for example if you specify 3 or more people, that third person will be taking the sofa bed).

	NOTE: It will be assumed that, if there are 2 people staying, they will be sharing the bed in the bedroom. If there are 3, 4 or 5 people staying, it will be assumed that there will be two people to each bed -- if either of these are NOT the case please let me know as this means that we will need to use more beds and there will a small incremental charges for this, primarily for extra time setting up and for usage of sheets, washing etc . I am however always happy to discuss exactly what you need , via an email or two, to make it work.

	I urge you to contact me before you book , if you are not clear about anything or there are any questions that you have that you do feel are not covered.

	See you soon, I hope.',

	My friend and I landed at JFK at 11pm - but Carol was super accommodating and stayed up late to let us in. The apartment is beautiful and super clean. It was spacious, bright and Carol and Matt were both super friendly and fun to chat to - which is a bonus. The location of the apartment is also great, with much happening (especially and most importantly regarding the food scene). I would definitely stay here again and recommend the spot to everyone else. Thanks for helping make a great trip even better!',

	My daughter and I just returned from staying with Carol and Marc. From beginning to end it was a perfect experience. We felt safe and well taken care of. Carol gave us perfect instructions how to go places and got us comfortable with navigating the subway. Their home is comfortable, clean and inviting. Marc has lots of information and great stories. My daughter and I loved sharing a glass of wine with them at night and chatting. Beautiful, cultured, kind people. You will enjoy your stay here. We will miss them.',

Museums include the Guggenheim, Metropolitan, Frick, the Neue Museums and many more  The stretch of 5th Ave where this apartment is located is called Museum Mile.  Also, this is one of the best places to head towards any destination or sightseeing in New York.  WE are 8 minutes from the 2, 3 trains and 5 minutes from the 6 train.

	You’ll love my place because of the open floor plan of the apartment, exposed brick walls, tall barrel ceilings, and spacious terrace. Bedroom and bathroom are private towards the terrace side of the house. If you like dogs your in for a treat with Mowgli, my Siberian Husky.',
	'The space

	All check ins will be done through lock box to eliminate timing issues and delays. The key will be available after 3pm unless early check in is requested. Please see lock box details after booking.

	Check out is at 11am. Check in is at 3pm. Please do send flight details and estimated time of arrival to ease the check in process.

	- It is a basement apartment that still gets a lot of light with 3 windows through the main space, 2 in the front room and 3 in the back room (the one for rent) that looks out onto the terrace.
	- Exposed brick and high barrel ceilings make the space really cool and wide open from the front door to the back hallway
	-The bathrooms are very nice and modern. The bathroom included is private for just you with a bathtub/shower and single sink. All towels are included (2) and there are large supply shampoo and soap.
	- The bedroom has 3 windows, a double bed, one closet and a chest of drawers for storage. (Sept 2018: Brand new Parachute bedding and Onsen luxury towels)
	- The living room is outfitted with a leather Room & Board couch and a 60” TV that has connection to Netflix, HBO, Showtime and Hulu. There is also a sound-bar and Apple wifi network to enjoy fast wifi and bluetooth music
	- The kitchen is outfitting with stainless steel appliances, marble countertops, plates and cups for both inside and alfresco dining. There is also a washer/dryer combination unit in the kitchen although I would recommend the communal dryers for the building.
	- The best for last! On the terrace there are quite a few amenities. Theres a sectional couch that can seat up to 6 people, two chaise lounges, a 8 person dining table, a BBQ, and two umbrellas for shade during the day. Lots of plants and good lighting for the night as well. The terrace is definitely yours to enjoy and if you would like to have a few friends over no problem, please just no parties or late night noise, as well as cleaning up would be greatly appreciated.
	- The entrance is the only odd part about the flat, generally in New York there are main stairs to enter the building, our door is actually under those stairs.
